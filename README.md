### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as backend developer on AI Coding application at Zhipu(Z.AI) since March 2025. Prior to that, I spent two years with the TikTok Growth Team.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning system architecture for LLM applications, with a focus on designing robust and high-throughput AI agent systems for production environments.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m actually more practical in user growth operations for content-oriented communities than in coding. Iâ€™ve independently built two communities from scratch, each with over 30,000 users.
